# Leetcode_Challenge_Solutions_by_Me
Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions Compilation! This repository contains my own solutions to a variety of LeetCode coding challenges. 
Each solution is accompanied by its problem name, difficulty level, a brief description, runtime and space complexity analysis, and the key data structures used. 
*Still continuously updating

**Overview**

This repository contains my solved LeetCode questions, organized for easy reference. 
Each solution includes the question's name, difficulty level, a brief description, runtime and space complexity analysis, and the data structures used. 
I've undertaken this project to showcase my problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithmic concepts.

Feel free to explore the solutions and provide any feedback!

**Contents**

The repository is organized into Java classes based on the topics of the LeetCode questions. 
Inside each directory, you'll find individual Java files corresponding to the solutions & each java file follows a standardized structure so it's easy to navigate. 

**How to Use**

Browse the repository's directories to find solutions based on topics of interest.
Inside each solution file contains:
1. **Problem Name:** The LeetCode question's name.
2. **Difficulty**: The difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) of the question.
3. **Description**: A brief overview of the problem.
4. **Runtime Complexity**: The time complexity of the solution.
5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity of the solution.
6. **Data Structure**: The key data structures used in the solution.

**Contributions**

I'm open to contributions and suggestions! If you find any bugs, optimizations, or new approaches to the problems, feel free to create a pull request!
